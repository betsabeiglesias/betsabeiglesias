# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm BetsabÃ© Iglesias

I'm currently studying software development at 42 Urduliz, where I'm focused on C, algorithms, and systems programming. With a strong background in finance and data analysis, I approach problems with both a technical and strategic mindset. I'm also expanding into full-stack development, working with JavaScript and React to build practical, user-focused solutions.
